Throughout this tutorial we will use `C` to refer to the key (`CTRL`)
and `M` to refer to the meta key (`Alt`). On most systems, `ALT` or `ESC`
correspond to `M`. On macOS, the Terminal application can be configured
to use `OPT` (`option`) as `M`.

| Name  | Key | Usually             |
|-------|-----|---------------------|
|Control| `C` | `CTRL`              |
| Meta  | `M` | `ESC`, `ALT`, `OPT` |
